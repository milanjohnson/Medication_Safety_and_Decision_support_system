        <strong>Research prototype. Decision support only. Not medical advice.</strong> Nothing here replaces the judgement of a

        <h2>What this is</h2>
        <p>
          A prototype for two subareas of the project “AI-Powered Personalized Medication Safety &amp; Decision Support System”
          (Group 4, course 24RM604, with Selvam Medicals):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A.</strong> Medicine information retrieval and generic alternative recommendation (cosine-similarity retrieval over drug-label text).</li>
          <li><strong>B.</strong> Medication safety risk detection and personalized alert generation (drug-pair interaction type from text, with explanation).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The data are DailyMed prescription labels, the DDI Extraction 2013 corpus and TAC 2017 labels. The Dashboard shows what is actually loaded.</p>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>The team's six-stage design. This app covers the stages marked below; the patient profile travels in the request body.</p>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No patient data is stored on the server.</strong> There is no database and no login; a profile exists only in the request that carries it (requirement R3).</li>
          <li>The first retrieval encoder and interaction classifier are <strong>classical baselines</strong> (TF-IDF cosine similarity; TF-IDF with a linear model). They are not deep learning and not Focal Loss. Where they are used, the screen says so.</li>
          <li>The interaction classifier is trained on sentences from DrugBank and MedLine. Label text is a different kind of text, so accuracy on labels may be lower. This has not been measured.</li>
          <li>Only the DailyMed zips present in <code>data/dailymed_rx</code> are used; the Dashboard shows exactly which and how many labels.</li>
          <li>Alternatives are matched on the active moiety of the active ingredient. That groups products that share a moiety but are not interchangeable. A professional confirms any substitution.</li>
          <li>Allergy, contraindication, duplicate-therapy and disease-precaution checks and the full patient profile are not built (see the coming-soon entries).</li>

          <li>User accounts and login, a database, and deployment.</li>
